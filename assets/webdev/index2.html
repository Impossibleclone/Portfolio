    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>My Fab Lab journey started with the exciting world of web development! Diving into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and perhaps even Javascript, I learned how to build the building blocks of websites. This first module provided a strong foundation for understanding how the web works and sparked my creativity for crafting online experiences.</p>    
    <p>My Fab Lab adventure began with a thrilling immersion into the world of web development. The very first day wasn't just about theory; we plunged headfirst into the practical world of HTML, the coding language that forms the foundation of web pages. We learned about HTML tags, those special instructions wrapped in angle brackets that act like a secret language for browsers. These tags tell the browser exactly how to display the content we create, bringing our web pages to life.

It was fascinating to discover the power of basic tags like 'p', which transforms plain text into a well-defined paragraph. We explored the hierarchy of headings, from the bold and prominent 'h1' all the way down to the more subtle 'h6', understanding how they structure and organize website content.  Adding pizazz with images became a reality as we learned about the 'img' tag, a gateway to incorporating visuals into our web creations.

This first day at Fab Lab wasn't just about memorizing tags; it was about igniting a passion for crafting the building blocks of the web. We started to see the potential to transform our ideas into interactive online experiences. It was an empowering introduction, laying the groundwork for our web development journey and whetting our appetites for the exciting tools and techniques that awaited us in the days to come.

        <a href="tbl.html"><img src="tbl.png" height="500px" alt=""></a>
      <p>This first day at Fab Lab wasn't just about memorizing tags; it was about igniting a passion for crafting the building blocks of the web. We started to see the potential to transform our ideas into interactive online experiences. To solidify our understanding of HTML, we embarked on a practical project – recreating our very own college timetable!<br>

The task was both challenging and rewarding. We learned to structure our timetable using HTML tables, defined by the 'table' and '/table' tags. Each day of the week became a table row 'tr', further divided into individual class periods using table cells '/td'. Filling these cells with our course names and timings brought the familiar structure of our college schedule to life online.<br>

It was a fantastic hands-on experience that showcased the power of HTML to organize and present information in a clear and visually appealing way. Recreating our timetable wasn't just about replicating a physical object; it was about understanding the fundamental building blocks of web pages. This first day laid the groundwork for our web development journey, and we eagerly awaited the exciting tools and techniques that awaited us in the days to come.</p>

    <a href="buttons.html"><img src="buttons.png" height="500px" alt=""></a>
    <div class="day3">
      <p>...and the learning curve continued to climb on day three at Fab Lab! We transitioned from the world of HTML, the foundation of web pages, to the realm of CSS, the language that controls their appearance. This was where things got visually exciting!<br>

CSS allowed us to style our creations, and our focus for the day was none other than buttons – those ever-important elements that drive user interaction. We learned about properties like background-color, border, and even text-shadow, letting us personalize the look and feel of our buttons.<br>

But day three wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about adding a touch of pizzazz with animations and transitions. We explored the power of CSS animations, where buttons could morph, pulsate, or even slide into view on hover. Transitions, on the other hand, allowed us to control the smoothness of these effects, creating a seamless and visually appealing user experience.<br>

By the end of the day, our static HTML buttons had transformed into dynamic and interactive elements. We were no longer just building websites; we were breathing life into them, making them not just functional but also engaging and delightful to use. This foray into CSS ignited a passion for visual storytelling, and we couldn't wait to see what other design possibilities awaited us in the coming days at Fab Lab.</p>

     <h1>Day 4:World Of Javascript</h1>
      <a href="time.html"><img src="time.png"height="500px" alt=""></a>
      <p>...Day three at Fab Lab marked a significant leap forward! We ventured beyond the realm of HTML and CSS, entering the exciting world of JavaScript – the language that adds interactivity and dynamism to web pages.  This was where things truly started to come alive!<br>

We began by exploring the fundamentals of JavaScript, learning how to write code that could manipulate elements on a webpage. We even delved into the concept of inline JavaScript, where code snippets are embedded directly within HTML tags, allowing us to add a touch of interactivity without the need for separate files.<br>

With these newfound skills, we embarked on a captivating project – creating a webpage that displayed the time in different countries!  This involved utilizing JavaScript's built-in Date object and functions like getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds() to retrieve the current time.  But the real magic happened when we learned how to leverage JavaScript's ability to dynamically update elements on the page.<br>

Imagine a webpage showcasing clocks for various cities around the globe.  By incorporating JavaScript, we could ensure these clocks constantly displayed the current time in each location.  We explored ways to format the time data for each location, potentially even adding features like automatic time zone adjustments.<br>

This project wasn't just about displaying time; it was about witnessing the power of JavaScript in action. We saw how code could breathe life into our creations, making them interactive and responsive.  The possibilities for building dynamic and user-driven web experiences suddenly seemed endless.  Leaving day three at Fab Lab, we were brimming with excitement, eager to delve deeper into the world of JavaScript and explore its potential in shaping our web development journey.</p>

     <h1>Day5:Navigating through Git & Github</h1>
      <a href=""><img src="" alt=""></a>
      <div class="steps">
      <h2>Git Setup:</h2>
      <p>Get Equipped:<br>

    1] Install Git on your system. It helps track your project's history.<br>
    (Optional) Create a free GitHub account. This lets you collaborate and store project history online.<br><br>

2] Initialize Your Project:<br>

    Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.<br>
    Run git init. This creates a hidden folder (.git) to manage version control within your project.<br><br>

3] Track Your Changes:<br>

    As you edit project files, Git doesn't automatically track them.<br>
    Use git add <file_name> to tell Git to include specific changes in the next commit.<br>
    Use git add . to add all modified files in your working directory.<br><br>

4] Commit Your Snapshots:<br>

    Run git commit with a clear message describing your changes.<br>
    This creates a "commit," a permanent record of your project's state at that time.<br>
    Think of it like saving milestones in your project's evolution.<br><br>

5] (Optional) Connect Remotely:<br>

    If you use GitHub, create a new project (repository) there.<br>
    Run git remote add origin <URL> to link your local project to the remote one on GitHub.<br>
    Use git push origin <branch_name> to upload your local commits to the remote branch (usually "main") on GitHub.<br>

          </p></div>
