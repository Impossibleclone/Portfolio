     <h1>Supporting the Structure</h1>
      <img src="support.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Types of Supports:<br>

    Lattice Support:<br> This is the most common type. It consists of a grid-like structure that fills the space under overhangs. While effective, it can be time-consuming to remove and might leave marks on the model's surface.<br>
    Tree-like Support:<br> This support structure resembles branches reaching up to hold overhangs. It uses less material and is easier to remove, but might not be suitable for all overhang shapes, particularly flat ones.<br>

      <h1>Completion of the Print Job</h1>
        <img src="control.png" alt="">
          <p>The Final Print Layer:<br>
Once the final layer is printed, the extruder head will typically park and the printing platform will move to its home position. The printer might beep or display a message indicating the print job is complete.<br>
Cooling Down:<br> Most printers will have a cooling period after the print job is finished. This allows the printed object to solidify completely before you remove it. It's important to avoid touching or moving the object during this time as it can warp or become damaged.</p>
